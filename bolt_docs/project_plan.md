# Project Plan: Authentication Flow Enhancements

## Overview
This project plan outlines the work needed to enhance the authentication flows in the HomeSchool application based on the updated user flow diagram. The enhancements will improve the user experience and add important functionality that is currently missing.

## Goals
- Implement email verification flow
- Add password recovery functionality
- Improve error handling during authentication
- Add session expiration handling
- Create account management features
- Implement navigation between authentication pages

## Timeline
Estimated completion time: 2-3 weeks

## Dependencies
- Supabase authentication services
- React Router for navigation
- Email service for verification and password reset emails

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Email delivery issues affecting verification and password reset
  - **Mitigation**: Implement retry mechanism and alternative verification methods

- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in authentication flows
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct security review and implement best practices for authentication

- **Risk**: User confusion during multi-step processes
  - **Mitigation**: Add clear instructions and progress indicators

## Success Criteria
- All authentication flows work as depicted in the updated user flow diagram
- Error handling provides clear guidance to users
- Session management properly handles expiration
- Account management features are accessible from both dashboards
- Navigation between authentication pages is intuitive
