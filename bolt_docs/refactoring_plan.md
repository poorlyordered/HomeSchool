# Refactoring Plan: Reducing File Size and Improving Maintainability

## Completed Refactoring

We've successfully refactored the GuardianDashboard component to reduce its size and improve maintainability. Here's what we've done:

1. **Created a new directory structure**:

   - Created `src/components/guardian/` directory to house the refactored components
   - Moved related components into this directory

2. **Extracted components**:

   - `GuardianHeader`: Contains the header section with school info, student selector, and action buttons
   - `TranscriptSection`: Contains the transcript generation section
   - `PDFPreviewModal`: Contains the PDF preview modal

3. **Created custom hooks**:

   - `useGuardianDashboard`: Manages state and data fetching for the GuardianDashboard component
   - `usePdfGeneration`: Manages PDF generation functionality (stub implementation for now)

4. **Simplified the main component**:
   - Original `GuardianDashboard.tsx` now just imports and renders the new component
   - New `guardian/GuardianDashboard.tsx` uses the extracted components and hooks

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved maintainability**: Each component now has a single responsibility
2. **Reduced file size**: No file exceeds 300 lines of code
3. **Better organization**: Related components are grouped together
4. **Easier testing**: Smaller components with focused functionality are easier to test
5. **Improved readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand

## Future Refactoring Opportunities

1. **PDF Generation**:

   - Implement proper PDF generation in the `usePdfGeneration` hook
   - Fix TypeScript issues with the @react-pdf/renderer library

2. **CourseList and TestScores**:

   - Consider further refactoring these components if they grow too large
   - Extract smaller components for individual sections

3. **State Management**:

   - Consider using a more robust state management solution like Redux or Context API
   - This would further simplify the components by removing prop drilling

4. **API Calls**:

   - Move all API calls to dedicated service files
   - This would make the hooks cleaner and more focused on state management

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement more robust error handling throughout the application
   - Create dedicated error boundary components

## Implementation Plan for Future Refactoring

1. **Phase 1**: Fix PDF generation issues

   - Properly implement the `usePdfGeneration` hook
   - Resolve TypeScript issues with @react-pdf/renderer

2. **Phase 2**: Refactor remaining large components

   - Identify components over 200 lines of code
   - Extract smaller, reusable components

3. **Phase 3**: Improve state management

   - Evaluate state management needs
   - Implement appropriate solution (Context API, Redux, etc.)

4. **Phase 4**: Enhance error handling
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Improve error reporting and recovery

## Conclusion

The refactoring has significantly improved the codebase by breaking down a large, monolithic component into smaller, more focused components. This makes the code more maintainable, easier to understand, and easier to test. Future refactoring efforts should focus on further improving the organization and maintainability of the codebase.
