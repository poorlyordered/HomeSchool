# HomeSchool Consolidated Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive testing strategy for the HomeSchool project, combining best practices, implementation plans, and roadmaps from our existing testing documentation. It serves as the single source of truth for our testing approach and future improvements.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach is built on these core principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test at multiple levels (unit, component, integration, E2E)
2. **Maintainable Tests**: Structure tests for long-term maintainability
3. **Performance Focus**: Optimize test execution for developer productivity
4. **Reliability**: Ensure consistent test results across environments
5. **Automation**: Automate testing processes where possible

## Energy/Focus Units Framework

Our project management approach uses a flexible energy/focus unit system rather than rigid timeframes. This approach applies to ALL project tasks, including testing:

- **Quick Win**: Immediate, low-effort task (30-60 minutes)
- **Sprint**: Focused 4-6 hour block
- **Deep Work**: Full day dedicated effort
- **Project Phase**: Multi-day concentrated work
- **Milestone**: Significant deliverable completion

This framework allows us to plan and execute tasks based on available energy levels rather than rigid timeframes, making it more adaptable to the realities of development work.

## Test Organization and Structure

### Current Structure

- Tests are primarily in `src/__tests__/` directory
- Component tests are in `src/__tests__/components/`
- Hook tests are in `src/__tests__/hooks/`
- Library tests are in `src/__tests__/lib/`
- Some tests are co-located with their implementation files

### Target Structure

We are moving toward a co-location pattern for better maintainability:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── CourseManagement.tsx
│   ├── CourseManagement.test.tsx  // Co-located test
│   ├── TestScores.tsx
│   └── TestScores.test.tsx        // Co-located test
├── hooks/
│   ├── useCourseManagement.ts
│   └── useCourseManagement.test.ts // Co-located test
```

### Bug Tracking Structure

```

├── docs/
│   ├── consolidated_testing_strategy.md
│   └── other documentation files
├── bugs/
│   ├── active/
│   │   ├── P1-critical/

│   └── resolved/
│       └── P3-medium/
└── reports/
    ├── weekly_status_template.md
    └── testing_progress_tracker.md
```

### Bug File Naming Convention

`BUG-001-component-short-description.md`

Example: `BUG-001-reset-password-token-validation.md`

## Component Testing Approach

### Testing Tools

- Jest as the test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Custom test helpers for common operations

### Testing Patterns

1. **Component Rendering Tests**
   - Verify components render without errors
   - Check for presence of key elements
   - Test different rendering states (loading, error, success)

2. **User Interaction Tests**
   - Simulate user events (click, type, etc.)
   - Verify UI updates correctly
   - Test form submissions and validations

3. **State Management Tests**
   - Verify state changes correctly
   - Test state-dependent rendering
   - Verify context providers and consumers

4. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test error states and messages
   - Verify error boundaries
   - Test recovery from errors

### Jest Configuration Optimization

```javascript
// jest.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./jest.setup.cjs'],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    // Module mappings
  },
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': ['ts-jest', {
      tsconfig: 'tsconfig.jest.json',
    }],
  },
  // Performance optimizations
  maxWorkers: '50%', // Limit parallel execution to half of available CPU cores
  cache: true,       // Enable caching for faster subsequent runs
};
```

## Test Performance Optimization

### Key Improvement Areas

1. **Standardized Mock Implementation**
   - Create centralized mock factories
   - Implement consistent mocking patterns
   - Use dedicated test setup files

2. **Optimized Test Execution**
   - Replace `userEvent` with `fireEvent` for synchronous event handling where appropriate
   - Improve timer mocking with `jest.useFakeTimers()`
   - Implement proper cleanup in `afterEach` blocks

3. **Reduced Test Complexity**
   - Break down large test files into smaller, focused test suites
   - Use more granular test cases
   - Implement proper test isolation

4. **Standardized Async Testing**
   - Create helper functions for common async patterns
   - Implement consistent timeout handling
   - Use a standardized approach for waiting for component updates

5. **Improved Mock Stability**
   - Create typed mock implementations
   - Implement realistic mock data generation
   - Use consistent mock reset patterns

## End-to-End Testing with Playwright

```

### Implementation Approach

1. **Page Object Model Pattern**
   - Abstract UI interactions into page classes
   - Encapsulate selectors and actions
   - Improve test maintainability

2. **Test Fixtures**
   - Reusable authentication setup
   - Common test data
   - Shared utilities

3. **Key Test Flows**
   - Authentication flows (login, registration, password reset)
   - Guardian flows (student management, course entry, transcript generation)
   - Student flows (view courses, test scores, transcript)

4. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Capture baseline screenshots
   - Compare against future changes
   - Detect unintended visual regressions

5. **API Testing Integration**
   - Test backend APIs directly
   - Verify data persistence
   - Test error handling

### CI/CD Integration
