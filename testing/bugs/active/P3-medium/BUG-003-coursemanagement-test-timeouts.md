# BUG-003: CourseManagement Component Test Timeouts

## Priority

P3 - Medium

## Status

Active

## Date Reported

2025-03-11

## Reported By

Cline

## Component

CourseManagement.tsx

## Description

The CourseManagement component tests are experiencing timeout issues. While basic tests for loading state and standard courses loading are working, most of the tests are failing with timeout errors. The tests are timing out even with increased timeout values (up to 15000ms).

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the CourseManagement component tests:
   ```
   npm test -- --verbose src/__tests__/components/CourseManagement.test.tsx
   ```
2. Observe that 10 out of 12 tests fail with timeout errors.

## Expected Behavior

All tests should pass within a reasonable timeout period.

## Actual Behavior

Only 2 basic tests pass (loading state and standard courses loading). The remaining 10 tests fail with timeout errors, even with increased timeout values.

## Environment

- Node.js
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- TypeScript

## Possible Causes

1. Issues with the mock implementations for Supabase
2. Complex asynchronous behavior in the component that's difficult to test
3. Form interactions not being properly simulated in the test environment
4. Potential race conditions in the component's state updates

## Attempted Solutions

1. Added proper form control associations with id and htmlFor attributes
2. Enhanced test structure with better timer mocking using jest.useFakeTimers()
3. Increased timeout values for tests and waitFor calls
4. Simplified test assertions to focus on core functionality

## Workaround

Currently, we have 2 passing tests that verify basic functionality:

1. Rendering the loading state
2. Loading standard courses on mount

For more comprehensive testing, manual testing is recommended until the test issues are resolved.

## Suggested Fix

1. Refactor the CourseManagement component to be more testable:
   - Break down into smaller, more focused components
   - Reduce dependency on complex asynchronous operations
   - Improve state management
2. Enhance the mock implementations for Supabase:
   - Create more reliable mock functions
   - Better simulate database responses
3. Consider using a different testing approach:
   - Use more integration-focused tests
   - Implement Playwright for end-to-end testing of this component

## Related Issues

None

## Notes

The component itself works correctly in the application. This is specifically an issue with the automated tests.
