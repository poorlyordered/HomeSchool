# BUG-001: ResetPassword - Insufficient Token Validation

## Status: Resolved

## Priority: P3 (Medium)

## Discovered: 2025-02-28

## Component: ResetPassword.tsx

## Description

The ResetPassword component checks if a token exists in the URL but doesn't verify if the token is valid before attempting to reset the password. If an invalid token is present, the user will see the password reset form, but the reset will fail when submitted, leading to a potentially confusing user experience.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the reset password page with an invalid token: `/reset-password?token=invalid-token`
2. Observe that the password reset form is displayed
3. Enter a new password and confirm password
4. Submit the form
5. Observe that the reset fails with an error message

## Expected Result

The component should validate the token before showing the password reset form. If the token is invalid, it should immediately show an error message and prompt the user to request a new reset link.

## Actual Result

The component shows the password reset form as long as any token is present, regardless of its validity. The user only discovers the token is invalid after filling out and submitting the form.

## Notes

- Supabase automatically handles the token from the URL when calling `resetPassword()`, but there's no pre-validation of the token
- The error handling in the component works correctly once the reset fails, but the user experience could be improved by validating earlier
- This could be fixed by adding a token validation step in the `useEffect` hook that runs when the component mounts

## Resolution

Fixed by implementing token validation in the ResetPassword component:

1. Added a new `validateResetToken` function in `auth.ts` that uses Supabase's `verifyOtp` method to validate the token before showing the password reset form.
2. Updated the ResetPassword component to call this validation function in the useEffect hook when the component mounts.
3. Added loading state to show a spinner while the token is being validated.
4. Only shows the password reset form if the token is valid.
5. Shows an appropriate error message if the token is invalid or expired.
6. Updated tests to cover the new token validation functionality.

This improves the user experience by immediately showing an error message for invalid tokens, rather than letting users fill out the form only to have it fail on submission.
