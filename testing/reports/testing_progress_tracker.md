## Progress Summary

- Implemented standardized mock implementation for Supabase:

  - Created `src/lib/__mocks__/supabase.ts` with standardized mock implementation
  - Created `src/__tests__/helpers/supabaseTestHelpers.ts` with helper functions
  - Updated Jest configuration to automatically mock Supabase
  - Updated TestScoreManagement.test.tsx to use the standardized mock
  - Improved test reliability and maintainability
  - Reduced code duplication across test files
  - Simplified test setup with helper functions

- Created comprehensive Test Performance Improvement Plan:

  - Identified key improvement areas for test organization, performance, and reliability
  - Developed a phased implementation approach using energy/focus units framework
  - Created a progress tracking system for monitoring implementation
  - Documented specific recommendations for standardizing mock implementations
  - Outlined strategies for optimizing test execution and reducing complexity
  - Added plan for test structure improvements and coverage expansion
  - Documented in testing/docs/test_performance_improvement_plan.md

- Created comprehensive Playwright implementation plan for E2E testing:

  - Designed detailed project structure and configuration
  - Created implementation approach using Page Object Model pattern
  - Planned authentication, guardian, and student flow tests
  - Outlined test fixtures and authentication helpers
  - Documented CI/CD integration approach
  - Created implementation timeline following energy/focus units framework
  - Added documentation for future reference

- Fixed test timeouts across component tests:

  - Replaced `userEvent` with `fireEvent` for synchronous event handling.
  - Standardized timer mocking using `jest.useFakeTimers()`.
  - Removed unnecessary explicit timeouts.
  - Applied fixes to 11 test files in `src/__tests__/components/`.

- Implemented test score management data loading functionality:

  - Added loadTestScores function to GuardianDashboard component
  - Implemented event listener for refreshTestScores event
  - Enhanced handleDeleteScore function to delete test scores from the database
  - Added loading indicator for test scores in GuardianDashboard
  - Enhanced StudentDashboard to load and display test scores from the database
  - Connected TestScores and TestScoreManagement components to the database
  - Implemented proper error handling for test score operations
  - Updated progress.md and activeContext.md to reflect the completed work

- Improved CourseManagement component and tests:
  - Added proper form control associations with id and htmlFor attributes for accessibility
  - Enhanced test structure with better timer mocking and longer timeouts
  - Fixed 2 basic tests (loading state and standard courses loading)
  - Identified issues with the remaining tests related to async behavior and mocking
  - Documented test limitations and potential future improvements
- Fixed StudentDashboard test failure (BUG-002) by updating the test to use the correct selector for the loading spinner
- Implemented course grouping by category feature in StudentDashboard and GuardianDashboard
- Created GroupedCourseList component for displaying courses organized by category
- Added database migration for linking courses to standard courses
- GuardianManagement tests have been implemented and are now passing
- StudentManagement tests have been fixed and are now passing
- Implemented comprehensive tests for AccountSettings component:
  - Created test suite with 19 test cases covering all component functionality
  - Tested all tabs: Profile, School, Security, and Delete Account
  - Implemented tests for form validation and error handling
  - Added proper mocking for Supabase operations and auth functions
  - All tests now passing successfully
  - Updated testing progress tracker to reflect completed work
- Tests for TestScoreManagement and TestScores components have been implemented

## Notes

- Bug tracking system set up with priority-based folders
- Weekly status report template created
- Testing plan documented with energy/focus units approach
- StudentManagement tests required fixes for form interaction and mock implementation
- GuardianManagement tests implemented with proper mocking of Supabase queries and error handling
- Course grouping by category feature implemented with accordion-style UI and color coding
- Fixed StudentDashboard test failure (BUG-002) by updating the test to use the correct selector for the loading spinner
- Moved BUG-002 from active to resolved folder
- Created BUG-003 to document CourseManagement component test timeout issues
